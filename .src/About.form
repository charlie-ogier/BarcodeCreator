You can then print out your code.<p> \n\nExample code for your Widget store \"K01P1725FFF\". The K will tell your Gambas program that it should expect a code of 11 characters, 01 is the location in the store where the item is stored, 'P1725' is the part number and 'FFF' is a hex number of the quantity. The actual barcode will have 'Start', 'End' and 'Check symbol'  characters so will be written as 'ÌK01P1725FFF3Î' but read as 'K01P1725FFF'. So using a Calc formula \"=MID(B8,3,2) & \" - \" & MID(B8,5,5) & \" - Qty \" & HEX2DEC(MID(A4,LEN(B8)-4,3))\" the following result can be created. See the spreadsheet by clicking the 'Sheet' button on the main Form.")
